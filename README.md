# Dynamic Recipe Hub Admin Dashboard

## Project Overview

The **Dynamic Recipe Hub** is a web-based platform that allows chefs to organize, manage, share, and sell their dishes.

It provides tools for managing recipes, dish listings, user accounts, user reports, and marketplace transactions.

### Features:

1. **Home Page**:  
   Displays analytics on user activity, sales, and performance metrics for administrators.

2. **Recipe Review Management**:  
   Interface for reviewing, approving, or deleting user-submitted reviews and comments. Administrators can manage reports of misleading or harmful content here.

3. **User Management**:  
   Lists all registered users with the ability to manage user roles, deactivate accounts, and respond to user-generated reports.

4. **Manage Contact Messages**:  
   Allows administrators to view and respond to messages sent through the contact form.
